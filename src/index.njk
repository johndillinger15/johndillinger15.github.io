<p class="mb-4">I am a PhD-trained scientist with a strong background in Epigenetics and nearly a decade of experience bridging the gap between life science research and strategic communication. After earning my PhD from the University of Regensburg in 2016, I joined Active Motif, where I currently serve as a Scientific Consultant and Podcast Host within the Marketing Department.</p>
<p class="mb-4">At Active Motif, I work at the intersection of science and communication — translating complex epigenetics topics for a broad audience. I initiated and produce <a href="https://activemotif.com/podcasts" class="font-bold">The Epigenetics Podcasts</a>, a podcast that features Key Opinion Leaders in the field of Epigenetics and highlights cutting-edge research. In addition to content development, I work extensively with Salesforce.com to manage customer engagement, including quote generation, case handling, and dashboard reporting.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Driven by curiosity and a focus on optimization, I apply AI tools to enhance efficiency and clarity in both professional and personal projects. In my current role, I’ve used AI-assisted Python scripting to automate routine processes and improve team workflows. One example is a sales data analysis tool I developed for Key Account Managers, which presents performance KPIs in a clear, browser-based dashboard—supporting better strategic decisions.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I’m a dedicated marathon and trail runner, having completed seven major marathons including New York, Berlin, and London. I bring the same persistence and long-term focus to my professional life. As a side project, I built an AI-powered platform to catalog all peaks in the Bavarian Forest, combining data visualization and Python scripting with my passion for trail running. This project is now integrated into my <a href="https://raincastle.blog" class="font-bold">personal running website</a>.</p>
