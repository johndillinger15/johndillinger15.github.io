<p class="mb-4">I bridge the gap between cutting-edge life science research and strategic communication, leveraging nearly a decade of experience to translate complex epigenetics research for diverse audiences. As a PhD-trained scientist with a strong background in Epigenetics, I earned my doctorate from the University of Regensburg in 2016 and currently serve as a Scientific Consultant and Podcast Host within the Marketing Department at Active Motif.</p>
<p class="mb-4">At Active Motif, I work at the intersection of science and communication — making complex epigenetics topics accessible to broad audiences. I created and host **The Epigenetics Podcasts**, featuring Key Opinion Leaders in the field and highlighting cutting-edge research. Beyond content development, I manage customer engagement through Salesforce.com, handling quote generation, case management, and dashboard reporting to drive strategic business outcomes.</p>
<p class="mb-4">I leverage AI and automation to drive efficiency across projects, applying these tools to enhance clarity and productivity in both professional and personal initiatives. In my current role, I've developed AI-assisted Python scripts that automate routine processes and improve team workflows. One notable example is a sales data analysis tool I built for Key Account Managers, which presents performance KPIs through a clear, browser-based dashboard—enabling better strategic decision-making and measurable workflow improvements.</p>
<p class="mb-4">As a seven-time major marathon finisher (including New York, Berlin, and London), I bring proven endurance and goal-oriented persistence to complex, long-term professional challenges. This same dedication drives my side projects, including an AI-powered platform I built to catalog all peaks in the Bavarian Forest. This project combines data visualization and Python scripting with my passion for trail running and is now integrated into my **personal running website**, demonstrating my ability to merge technical skills with personal interests to create innovative solutions.</p>
